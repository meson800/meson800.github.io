  abstract = {Engineered microbial communities show promise in a wide range of applications, including environmental remediation, microbiome engineering, and synthesis of fine chemicals. Here we present methods by which bacterial aggregates can be directed into several distinct architectures by inducible surface expression of heteroassociative protein domains (SpyTag/SpyCatcher and SynZip17/18). Programmed aggregation can be used to activate a quorum-sensing circuit, and aggregate size can be tuned via control of the amount of the associative protein displayed on the cell surface. We further demonstrate reversibility of SynZip-mediated assembly by addition of soluble competitor peptide. Genetically programmable bacterial assembly provides a starting point for the development of new applications of engineered microbial communities in environmental technology, agriculture, human health, and bioreactor design.},
