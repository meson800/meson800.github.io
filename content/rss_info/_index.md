[Really Simple Syndication (RSS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) is the original, and arguably better way to consume periodic content. Unlike modern subscription systems, RSS is privacy-respecting and wholly user-controlled. I have different feeds available depending on what you want to subscribe to.
