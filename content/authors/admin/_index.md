I'm a PhD student at MIT working in the Galloway Lab. Out of all of the systems that chemical engineers
examine, I've found that biological systems are the most fascinating, complex, and challenging systems
we could possibly dream of working with.

I've also always enjoyed coding. My favorite language was and still is C++; I've written several toy
projects and contributed to several open-source development efforts with C++. I also enjoy Python, and use it
pretty frequently as my go-to "glue", data-analysis, or prototyping language.

When I'm not doing research or programming, I like to dabble: 3D modeling and animation, video editing, sailing, quadcopter construction, rocket building have all been recent interests of mine.
